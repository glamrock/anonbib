Recent events have clearly indicatedthat privacy is increasingly at risk on the global networks. Individualefforts have, so far, worked well in maintaining for most Internet users amodicum of anonymity. With the growth of increasingly sophisticatedtechniques to defeat anonymity, there will be a need for both standards andpolicies to continue to make privacy on the Internet a priority.</I><p><img src="img/hl/content.gif" alt="Contents"><br><a href="#intro">Introduction</A><br><a href="#etfap">Early tools for anonymous postings</A><br><a href="#acs">A Cypherpunk solution</A><br><a href="#wttgb">Watching the traffic go by</A><br><a href="#t">Timers</A><br><a href="#snfi">Spamming networks for identities</A><br><a href="#m">Mixmaster</A><br><a href="#rfe">Remailers for everyone</A><br><a href="#c">Conclusion</A><br><a href="#n">Notes</A><br><P><a name="intro"><img src="img/hl/i.gif"></A><br>In 1979, Tom Truscott and James Elliott of Duke University experimentedwith a way to share files with UNIX, using computers at Duke and theUniversity of North Carolina. From these humble and unpretentiousbeginnings, where it was expected that traffic would amount to just one ortwo messages a day, Usenet grew into a number of groups dedicated tospecific topics.<P>The growth of Usenet led to a re-organization of the newsgroups a decadeago, into seven areas dedicated to computer science (comp.), social issues(soc.), science (sci.), recreation (rec.), news (news.), discussions(misc.), and debate (talk.). This growth was also stimulated by thedevelopment of specific protocols to allow the distribution of Usenetinformation over the Internet, and the rapid interest in the Internet andelectronic communication itself. Usenet has become one of the mostsuccessful vehicles for global discourse, with nearly 100,000 Usenet sitesand 3 million users scattered around the world [<a href="#1">1</A>].<P>There was some concern early in the history of Usenet for newsgroupsoutside the Usenet universe. The alternative hierarchy in fact began overobjections by Brian Reid, the moderator of a recipe newsgroup; hisalt.gourmand group was the first of now many alternative groups dedicatedto many diverse topics. The enthusiasm for these alternative newsgroups,and other more traditional groups, led for a need for anonymity on theInternet.<P><a name="etfap"><img src="img/hl/etfap.gif" alt="Early tools for anonymous postings"><br></A>Readers of Usenet groups which dealt with sensitive topics - thealt.support.* hierarchy in particular - developed a need for anonymousmail. To solve this problem, Karl Kleinpaste built a pseudonym server,which created pseudonymous identities. Those posting to sensitivenewsgroups could protect their identities from their coworkers, employers,and even their families.<P>The system was set up so that it would work transparently and very easily.To make an anonymous posting to a newsgroup, a Usenet reader would send anelectronic mail message to the pseudonym server, directing the server tosend the contents of a post to the Usenet group. The actual identity of thesender would be replaced with a pseudonymous ID, allocated by the server.This identification would allow responses from the newsgroup to theposting. The server in turn maintained a database that correlated eachpseudonymous ID to the real e-mail address of every user. When a mailmessage was sent to the pseudonymous ID on the server, the message itselfwould also receive the same anonymous treatment by the server. The authorof a given message to the server would also be allocated a pseudonymous IDand then forwarded to the recipient.<P>This pseudo-anonymous service was used heavily, and a number of systemswere set up to handle the traffic. Some of these servers lasted only weeksor months. Discussions raged in newsgroups over the ethics of anonymouspostings. There was abuse of the initial server itself, resulting in itsmigration from site to site and from owner to owner. Eventually, Johan'Julf' Helsingius in 1992 established one of the most heavily usedpseudo-anonymous servers in Finland, the anon.penet.fi server.<P>Julf's server is the most prominent pseudo-anonymous server on the Internetwith over 500,000 users sending about 8,000 messages every day [<a href="#2">2</A>]. Julfcontinues to run the server as a free service to the Internet community inthe face of threats and abuse, at the cost of at least $1,000/month [<a href="#3">3</A>].<P>Anon.penet.fi provides only very minimal security. Since it maintains adatabase that maps anonymous identities to real e-mail addresses, it issusceptible to compromises. The best example of this sort of invasivemanipulation involved the Church of Scientology last year. On February 8,1995, Helsingius turned over to Finnish officials the identity of ananonymous user of his server, based on a complaint initially filed by theChurch of Scientology with the Los Angeles, Calif. police and the U. S.Federal Bureau of Investigations. Helsingius, as a Finnish citizenoperating anon.penet.fi on Finnish soil, was required to surrender thespecific information or lose his server completely [<a href="#4">4</A>]. Thus, anon.penet.fi- and other pseudonym servers this type - was shown to be not secure, notfrom a technical angle but from a legal one.<P>Helsingius has instituted a number of mechanisms to reduce thesusceptibility of his server to compromise, but the anon.penet.fi serverstill provides only a low level of security. For instance, it doesn't havea distributed trust model, depending on just a single server [<a href="#5">5</A>]. Disablethe server and no one can use it. Infiltrate the server and compromisehundreds of thousands of users.<P><a name="acs"><img src="img/hl/acs.gif" alt="A Cypherpunk solution"><br></A>In late 1992, a group of cryptography enthusiasts and professionals wasfounded in a meeting in the San Francisco area. Calling themselves&quot;cypherpunks&quot; (a term invented by Judith Milhon as a play on the'cyberpunk' science fiction genre and the word cipher), a mailing list wasstarted. It now generates at least 50 messages a day and includes almost2,000 members worldwide [<a href="#6">6</A>]. At the same time, two of the group's founders,Eric Hughes and Hal Finney, built a secure anonymous mail system for theInternet. Their system was a very weak version of the so-called &quot;digitalmix&quot; envisioned in the early 1980s by David Chaum [<a href="#7">7</A>].<P>Hughes and Finney's 'cypherpunk remailer' system fixes the problems of theanon.penet.fi-style anonymous server with distributed trust and public-keycryptography [<a href="#8">8</A>]. While the security provided by this system was muchstronger than anon.penet.fi, it did not provide users with sufficientsafeguards to defeat a determined and technically sophisticated attacker.<P>The cypherpunk remailer system is more complicated in that it is a network,not just a single server. In order for the security of the entire networkto be compromised, every node on the network must be compromised. How doesit work? A user desiring anonymity sends a message to one of the remailersin the network. The message includes instructions to the remailer,requesting it to send the payload to another remailer in the same network.The payload is then shipped to the next remailer, removing in the processall identifying information on the originating user. The next remailer inthe network follows the same instructions from the previous hop andforwards the payload along. When the last remailer in the network isreached, the message is sent to the intended recipient, either to aspecific e-mail account or to a Usenet newsgroup.<P>Because the system uses public-key cryptography at each 'hop' along thenetwork in the process, a remailer can only read its own commands. Themessage itself cannot be read. Here's an example. Teresa sends a message toVictor, chaining her message through remailers W, X, Y, and Z. In thesequence of events, remailer W would only know to send some arbitraryencrypted message to remailer X. Remailer X can decrypt the instruction tosend the message to its next hop, remailer Y. Remailer X has no idea whatthe final destination of the message will be. Eventually, when remailer Zfollows the instructions to deliver the message to Victor's mail box, ithas no idea that Teresa originally sent it. In order for the source of amessage through the network to be discovered, the entire chain must becompromised. Sophisticated traffic analysis might reveal some detailshowever and I will describe those techniques shortly.<P>Could this system provide security against non-technical but legal demands?First, if all remailers in a given chain were located in differentjurisdictions (countries or states), it would be a significant hurdle forany one agency to obtain cooperation in all jurisdictions and force someinformation to be revealed. More important, the remailer network providesdistributed trust, that is the system is not dependent on just oneremailer. Even if all of the operators of all the remailers in the networkwere forced to cooperate by legal injunctions, as long as they did notcooperate with each other, messages would remain anonymous.<P>Eventually, the ability to reply through a remailer chain was implemented.A sender wishing to anonymously receive mail from a recipient could createwhat is now called a reply block [<a href="#9">9</A>]. The reply block is merely amulti-encrypted remailer message itself. The final destination of themessage is the actual identity of the anonymous entity. Someone wishing topreserve their identity in this way can create such a reply block andpublish it, or, include it in their e-mail. People wishing to send messagesto this person use the reply block to send messages through the remailernetwork. The messages reach their destination anonymously.<P>Functionally, the reply block is very cumbersome. It requires that thosecorresponding with anonymous users take special steps to include the replyblocks in their electronic replies. In order to make such reply blockseasier to use, Matt Ghio wrote the alpha.c2.org nymserver, running atCommunity ConneXion [<a href="#10">10</A>].<P>The alpha.c2.org nymserver provides the full functionality of theanon.penet.fi server, while protecting privacy to a much greater degree. Bynot storing the actual identities of its users, the alpha.c2.org server issafe against even legal recourses.<P>In order to create an identity, our hypothetical user, Teresa, merelycreates a reply block that points right back to herself. The reply block isthen sent in encrypted form through a remailer chain, to the administrativeaddress for the alpha.c2.org nymserver. The server software takes theanonymous mail message, and allocates an anonymous identity according tothe instructions in the actual message. The reply block is then stored onthe server. When mail for the anonymous identity arrives, it is forwardedthrough the remailer network, according to the instructions in the replyblock.<P>The system is secure against legal compromises because the nymserver itselfhas no knowledge of the identity of the anonymous user. The nymserver isonly aware of the existence of the encrypted reply block. It is encryptedwith the key of a foreign remailer, which is not under the control of thenymserver. Given a court order or other legal directive to reveal theidentity of a given pseudonym, the server can only reveal informationregarding the first remailer in the chain and the block encrypted for thenext remailer. In order to reveal the identity of the user, properlyauthorized officials would have to track every remailer in the chain. Ifthe remailers are multi-jurisdictional, the process becomes very difficult.<P><a name="wttgb"><img src="img/hl/wttgb.gif" alt="Watching the traffic go by"><br></A><img src="img/remail1.gif" align=right>Sophisticated traffic analysis could trivially defeat the protectionprovided by the remailer network in its current configuration. An agentcould monitor the network itself, examining and recording message sizes,message timing, and message contents. Sophisticated traffic analysis wouldrequire an analysis of all of the network traffic in and out of all theremailers. For some agencies and organizations, with sufficient manpowerand computing resources, this sort of approach is highly possible.<P>How would this sort of traffic monitoring work? What kind of informationwould be secured? First, an agent would monitor message times. Simply, thetime at which a message enters and leaves a network would be recorded.Second, an agent would analyze message sizes. In a standard remailer chain,message sizes decrease by a predictable amount at each hop along the chain.Finally, an agent could determine the actual identity of a reply block byusing a spamming the network. Spamming - sending a large number of unwantedmessages - in this case would use a given reply block. In combination withanalyses of message times and sizes, this approach could provide muchuseful information to an agent.<P><a name="t"><img src="img/hl/t.gif" alt="Timers"><br></A>In order to correlate messages to time, an agent will study traffic goinginto and out of a specific group of remailers. This agent will monitorwhich messages enter and leave the remailers at approximately the sametime. For example, the agent would note that a message from teresa@someisp.net was sent to remailerone@abcdefg.net at 04:50. It would record thatanother message was sent from remailerone@abcdefg.net tofinalhop@remailer.net at 04:52. It would also register that a third messagewas seen sent from finalhop@remailer.net to victor@xyz.gov at 04:53. Basedon this cursory evidence, the agent could reasonably assume thatteresa@someisp.net sent a message to victor@xyz.gov<P>An additional tactic for an agent would be to examine message sizes in thecourse of routine traffic analysis. Suppose the message betweenteresa@someisp.net and remailerone@abcdefg.net was one kilobyte long.The message was reduced between remailerone@abcdefg.net tofinalhop@remailer.net to 800 bytes. On its final digital diet, the messagebetween finalhop@remailer.net and victor@xyz.gov fell to 600 bytes. Theagent could conclude that teresa@someisp.net sent a message tovictor@xyz.gov  Combining both of these methodologies would provide a highdegree of confidence to the agent that the initial analysis of traffic wascorrect.<P><a name="snfi"><img src="img/hl/snfi.gif" alt="Spamming networks for identities"></A><BR>In addition to using the previously described strategies, an agent couldalso reveal the identity of a alpha.c2.org-style pseudonym through a simplespam attack. By sending a large quantity of messages through the network toa given pseudonym, the agent would once again monitor the network, thistime tracing the spam &quot;lump&quot; through the system. The information gleaned bythe agent in the course of the processing of this &quot;lump&quot; by the networkcould be used to trace a given recipient.<P><a name="m"><img src="img/hl/m.gif" alt="Mixmaster"></A><BR><img src="img/remail2.gif" align=right>As these scenarios demonstrate, Hughes and Finney's remailer network is notsufficient robust to prevent a sophisticated and dedicated attack. Inresponse to these possibilities, Lance Cottrell developed the Mixmasterremailer system [<a href="#11">11</A>]. Mixmaster uses reordering and message padding toprotect against traffic analysis [<a href="#12">12</A>].<P>Mixmaster was created to solve traffic analysis problems in older remailerapproaches to anonymity. It protects users against higher level threatsfrom organizations with strong eavesdropping capabilities. Mixmaster'sphilosophy assumes that all network links are compromised and that evensome specific nodes in the chain are compromised.<P>While both Mixmaster and the Hughes/Finney approach assume that some nodesin the network may be compromised, Mixmaster goes one step further byassuming that every network connection is being monitored. In order toprotect against those with the computing resources to monitor all networktraffic, Mixmaster creates specific mechanisms to overcome agents studyingtraffic patterns. These mechanisms include reordering and message padding.<P>One means by which an agent, with access to all network traffic, couldviolate the remailer network is by correlating message times. For example,suppose Teresa sends a message at 15:45 to remailer A. This remailer inturn sends another message at time 15:46 to remailer B, which then sends amessage to Victor at 15:47. The agent does not need to spend any timelooking at individual nodes or encryption schemes, thanks to logs of themessage times. The agent knows that Teresa and Victor are in communication.<P>Mixmaster protects against this approach by reordering messages flowingthrough the remailer. It simply does not deliver messages immediately.Mixmaster waits until a large number of messages are stored in theremailer. It then randomly mixes the order of all the messages, sending allof the messages out in one large and random batch. This processing defeatsa basic message-timing analysis of traffic.<P>A second compromising approach would analyze message sizes. In theHughes/Finney remailer, message sizes decrease by a certain amount at everyhop. Suppose Teresa sends a message measuring 513 bytes to Remailer A. Thisremailer then sends a message with 490 bytes to remailer B. Remailer B thenpackages a message of 467 bytes to Victor. Again, an agent would be able toconclude that Teresa and Victor are sending messages to each other,violating their privacy. <P>Mixmaster protects against this approach by making every message exactlythe same size. A Mixmaster message has a message format which includes 20header fields, each the same size, and a body field, which is apredetermined size. Any messages sent through the network are padded to thesize of the body field. Every message is the exact same size.<P>Another approach involves tracking the actual message bodies. This methodis possible in servers that preserve a message body as it passes from oneremailer to another. It is possible because some servers alter just thereply block and do not disguise the message in any way. An agent wouldsimply trace message bodies through theremailer network in order to detect users. Mixmaster re-encrypts the bodyof the message with a new key at every hop, confusing an agent by changingthe contents of the message body.<P><a name="rfe"><img src="img/hl/rfe.gif" alt="Remailers for everyone"></A><BR>It may seem, from these descriptions, that the actual, everyday use ofremailers is difficult. This is hardly the case. Remailers are actuallyvery easy to use thanks to a number of client front-ends available forseveral computing platforms. For example, with UNIX premail is just anexample of one client program. For Microsoft Windows, there are severaloptions, including Private Idaho and John Doe [<a href="#13">13</A>].<P>Premail is an excellent program written by Raph Levien for use withremailers [<a href="#14">14</A>]. It fully supports Finney/Hughes-style remailers,alpha.c2.org, and Mixmaster. In addition to being a remailer client,premail supports PGP and S/MIME for standard secured Internet e-mailwithout any identity and traffic analysis protections. Premail works withmh, elm, and newer versions of Netscape Navigator for UNIX.<P><a name="c"><img src="img/hl/c.gif" alt="Conclusion"></A><br>As the remailer network grows, a number of new developments will be neededin the near future if anonymity will survive. First, it requires realstandards, with the actual support of the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF). Only by the actual labor of an IETF Working Group establishing anofficial standard will the remailer network gain the respectability itneeds for ubiquitous deployment.<P>Second, a secure anonymous payment system must be incorporated into thenetwork. In order for privacy to survive further commercialization of theInternet, it must be profitable. In order to make remailing profitable itmust be offered as a fee-based service.<P>Some work is being done towards making privacy on the Internet economicallypossible. For example, there is one Web-based remailer interface that nowaccepts electronic cash in payment for its services [<a href="#15">15</A>]. The very natureof communications on the Internet will depend on the successful deploymentof a number of schemes to preserve anonymity, in messages, purchases, andfile transfers. Research by a number of groups on revised remailer designs,and the availability of free and low-cost options, clearly indicate theimportance of anonymity to the Internet community as a whole. Onlyorganized and standardized efforts will ensure continued privacy in thefuture.<p><img src="img/hl/ta.gif" alt="The Author"><br><b>Sameer Parekh</B><br><a name="author"></A><a href="mailto:sameer@c2.net">sameer@c2.net</A>,<br> snail mail: Community ConneXion<br>3038A Mabel Street, Berkeley, Calif. 94702 U.
