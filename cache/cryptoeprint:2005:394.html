<b>Obfuscated Ciphertext Mixing</b><p />
<i>Ben Adida and Douglas Wikström</i><p />
<b>Abstract. </b>Mixnets are a type of anonymous channel composed of a handful of trustees that, each in turn, shuffle and rerandomize a batch
ciphertexts. For applications that require verifiability, each
trustee provides a proof of correct mixing. Though mixnets have
recently been made quite efficient, they still require secret
computation and proof generation after the mixing process.
  
We introduce and implement Obfuscated Ciphertext Mixing, the
obfuscation of a mixnet program. Using this technique, all proofs
can be performed before the mixing process, even before the
inputs are available. In addition, the mixing program does not need
to be secret: anyone can publicly compute the shuffle (though
not the decryption). We frame this functionality in the strongest
obfuscation setting proposed by Barak et. al., tweaked for
the public-key setting. For applications where the secrecy of the
shuffle permutation is particularly important (e.g. voting), we also
consider the Distributed Obfuscation of a Mixer, where
multiple trustees cooperate to generate an obfuscated mixer program
such that no single trustee knows the composed shuffle permutation.
