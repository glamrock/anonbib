<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>On the Internet it is easy for someone to obtain a new identity.&nbsp; This <br>
introduces opportunities to misbehave without paying reputational <br>
consequences. A large degree of cooperation can still emerge, through <br>
a convention in which newcomers ``pay their dues'' by accepting <br>
poor treatment from players who have established positive <br>
reputations. One might hope for an open society where newcomers are <br>
treated well, but there is an inherent social cost in making the <br>
spread of reputations optional. We prove that no equilibrium can <br>
sustain significantly more cooperation than the dues-paying <br>
equilibrium in a repeated random matching game in which players have <br>
finite lives and the ability to change their identities, and there is <br>
a small but nonvanishing probability of mistakes and a large number of <br>
players. </p>

<p>Although one could remove this inefficiency by disallowing anonymity, <br>
this is not practical or desirable in a wide variety of <br>
transactions. We discuss the use of entry fees, which permit newcomers <br>
to be trusted but exclude some players with low payoffs, thus <br>
introducing a different inefficiency. We also discuss the use of <br>
unchangeable pseudonyms, and describe a mechanism which implements <br>
them using standard encryption techniques. <br>
