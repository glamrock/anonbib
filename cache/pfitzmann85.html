<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>

In present-day communication networks, the network operator or an
intruder could easily observe when, how much and with whom the users
communicate (traffic analysis), even if the users employ end-to-end
encryption. With the increasing use of ISDNs, this becomes a severe
threat.

<p> Therefore, we summarize basic concepts to keep the recipient and
sender or at least their relationship unobservable, consider some
possible implementations and necessary hierarchical extensions, and
propose some suitable performance and reliability enhancements.

<p> <b>Keywords:</b> traffic analysis, user observability, anonymity,
fault-tolerance, ISDN, MIX-network, DC-network, RING-network,
switched/broadcast network

<h1>0 Motivation</h1> 

Public and private communication networks have a growing importance
for our daily life. We use them for telephony, telegraphy, television,
videotex, radio and in the near future we will use them for video
telephony, electronic mail, ordering and receiving of newspapers, home
banking, etc.

<p> All these services will be integrated in a so-called Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN). If such a network is built as planned
e.g. by the german PTT and operated on a "transmission on demand
basis" even for the classical broadcast services TV and radio, major
parts of any user's life might easily be observed by the PTT or by an
intruder

<p> Eavesdropping can be foiled by link-by-link encryption [2], but
this does not foil attackers at the stations (e.g. via Trojan Horses).

<p> There are some well known measures allowing users themselves to
decrease their observability. The content of a message can be
sufficiently hidden by end-to-end encryption. However, an attacker can
still observe who sends how many messages to whom and at what time
(traffic analysis). To hide this information, too, they can use public
network stations (e.g. telephone boxes) instead of private ones. This
will prevent observation but is very uncomfortable for the users
(e.g. who would watch TV in a video telephone box?). If they use
private network stations, they can only try to hide their behaviour by
making their network stations do more things than necessary at other
times than necessary. For example a user can order a whole newspaper
or several newspapers instead of a single article, and he can do so at
any time before he wants to read them. This is an easy but expensive
measure and not suitable for services like telephony.

<p>So the only way to decrease user observability in a comfortable and
cheap fashion seems to be to design a network for anonymity and not to
try to realize anonymity afterwards.

<p>Of course, the standard requirements for an ISDN, i.e. high
performance and reliability, have to be met, too.

<p>This paper describes the existing proposals for anonymous networks
in a systematic way and some options allowing them to be adapted to
meet the stringent requirements on performance and reliability.

<h1>1 Basic concepts for anonymous networks</h1>

<h2>1.1 A closer look at anonymity</h2>

What we would like to realize is absolute anonymity against every
possible attacker. But an attacker can control all network stations,
all lines, and even the communication partner and so absolute
anonymity is theoretically impossible. Therefore we need reasonable
models of possible attackers.

<p>There are several possible attackers: the administration, foreign
states, companies, one's neighbours and communication partners. During
the design of an anonymous network these possible attackers have to be
translated into terms of stations and lines. A station is always under
control of its owner and might be under control of everybody who has
had access to it so far, e.g. its manufacturer, because he might have
installed a Trojan Horse [24, 29]. Trojan Horses are a serious problem
in stations with high complexity, e.g. switching centers. In simple
user stations they can be detected (if tried) more easily. Lines are
assumed to be owned by the PTT. Normally they can easily be observed
by the PTT or an eavesdropper, but by physical measures such an attack
can be made much more difficult.

<p>Given a model of the attacker we have to define what we want to
keep hidden from him. A strong possibility is to keep the sender and
the recipient of a message secret. A weaker possibility is to keep
only their relationship secret, i.e. sending and receiving of physical
messages is observable, but it is infeasable for an attacker to link
the physical message sent by the sender and the physical message
received by the recipient.

<h2>1.2 Recipient anonymity</h2>

Receiving a message can be made completely anonymous to the network by
delivering the message to all stations (broadcast). If the message has
an intended recipient, a so called addressee, it has to contain an
attribute by which he and nobody else can recognize it as addressed to
him [12]. This attribute is called an implicit address in contrast to
an explicit address, which describes a place in the network.

<p>Implicit addresses can be distinguished according to their
visibility, i.e. whether they can be tested for equality or not. An
implicit address is called invisible, if it is only visible to its
addressee and is called visible otherwise [30].

<p>Invisible implicit addresses can be realized with a public key
cryptosystem. A message is addressed by encrypting it (or a part of
it) with a public key of the addressee. Each station decrypts all
messages with each of its private keys and uses the message redundancy
to decide which messages are addressed to it.

<p>Conversely, any invisible addressing scheme can be used for public
key distribution: If A wants to communicate an n bit key to B, A
chooses n messages randomly, and addresses them to B if the
corresponding key bit is 1, and addresses them not to B otherwise. A
sends these n messages in one explicitly addressed message to B. This
addressee-anonymity-based public key distribution protocol corresponds
to a sender-anonymity-based one proposed by Alpern and Schneider [1].

<p>If a secret key of a faster conventional cryptosystem has already
been exchanged, that key can also be used for invisible implicit
addressing [17 pp. 111..112]. If this is done to save decipherment
cost, each packet should start with a bit telling which cryptosystem
is used for invisible implicit addressing.

<p>Visible implicit addresses can be realized much easier: Users
choose arbitrary names for themselves, which can then be prefixed to
messages.

<p>Another criterion to distinguish implicit addresses is their
distribution. An implicit address is called public, if it is known to
every user (like telephone numbers today) and private if the sender
received it secretly from the addressee either outside the network or
as a return address or by a generating algorithm the sender and the
addressee agreed upon [12, 17].

<p>Public addresses should not be realized by visible implicit
addresses to avoid the linkability of the visible public address of a
message and the addressed user.

<p>Private addresses can be realized by visible addresses but then
each of them should be used only once.

<p>All possible combinations of addressing modes and address
distribution are shown in figure 1.


<h2>1.3 Unlinkability of sender and recipient </h2>

<p>This form of anonymity can be realized by a special network
station, a so called MIX, which collects a number of messages of equal
length from the senders, discards repeats, changes their encodings,
and forwards the messages to the recipients in a different order
(figure 2).

<p>This measure hides the relation between sender and recipient of a
message from everybody but the MIX and the sender of the message. By
using more than one MIX to forward a message from the sender to the
recipient, the relation is hidden from every attacker in the network
who does not control all MIXes which the message passed, nor has the
cooperation of the sender [5].

<p>Care must be taken that an attacker cannot submit all messages
which are mixed at the same time except for one. Otherwise he might
link the message he did not send, too.

<h2>1.4 Sender anonymity </h2>

A powerful scheme for sender anonymity is superposed sending which is
published in [8, 10] and is called DC-network (dining cryptographers
network) there.

<p>Each user station generates at least one key bit for each message
bit and sends each key bit to exactly one other user station over a
secure channel. To send one bit every user station adds modulo 2
(superposes) all generated and received key bits and its message bit
if there is one. The sums are sent over the network and added up
modulo 2. The result is distributed to all user stations. The result
is the sum of all sent message bits, because every key bit was added
twice (figure 3). Therefore the scheme realizes a multi-access channel
with collisions. For its efficient use a medium access protocol [28]
preserving anonymity is needed. Two of them are mentioned in [8].

<p>If an attacker controls all lines and some of the user stations, he
gets no information about the sender of a message among the other
users, as long as their key graph, i.e. the graph with the users as
nodes and the keys as edges, is connected.

<p>Superposed sending requires the exchange of a tremendous amount of
randomly chosen keys. To reduce costs, pseudorandomly generated keys
can be used instead, reducing information-theoretic [26] to
complexity-theoretic security.

<p>The expensive generation, distribution and superposing of keys (and
messages) of the concept of superposed sending can be avoided if the
network is designed for preventing attackers from physically observing
all lines connecting a user with the rest of the world.

<p>A simple and efficient way to do so is to connect the user stations
by RINGs, which are in wide use for local area networks. If an
anonymous medium access protocol is used, a user station is only
observable if its two neighbour stations collude or the lines are
tapped. The latter attack can be prevented by running the cable in an
appropriate way [20, 21]. Then, it is approximately as difficult to
observe the sending of a user station as to observe its owners
behavior at home directly by hidden microphones, laser-based bugs or
EMI emissions of the user station [15, 16, 11].

<p>Anonymous medium access protocols are slotted ring with sender
remove and token ring, both with exhaustive service [13, 14]. This is
illustrated in figure 4.


<h1>2 Performance</h1>

The two main performance characteristics of networks are throughput
and transfer delay. Their importance depends on the services the
network is supposed to offer. Throughput and transfer delay are less
critical for services like electronic mail, only throughput is
critical for services like file transfer, only transfer delay for
services like telephony and both are critical for video telephony.

<h2>2.1 Some remarks on the basic concepts for anonymous networks </h2>

Analyzing the performance of the concepts of section 1 must go along
with considering how they would be implemented physically.

<p>In local areas with a few hundred stations the performance of a
RING-network implemented as a physical ring is roughly as good as or
even better than that of an equally expensive usual star or bus
network [3, 4, 18]. However, performance and reliability of
RING-networks with more than 10000 stations become unacceptable.

<p>In [8], David Chaum suggests implementing superposed sending on a
physical ring network. Each message bit requires two circulations
around the ring: in the first round, the user bits are successively
superposed by the users, in the second round, the resulting bit is
broadcasted.

<p>This implementation seems quite efficient because under the
assumption of uniformly distributed traffic it increases the average
expenditure of transmission only by a factor of four compared with a
traditional ring access protocol in which the recipient removes the
message from the ring, whereas on a star or tree network the factor is
the number of stations. But the amount of transmission on each line,
i.e. the required bandwidth, is the same for all implementations, so
implementations on stars or trees might still be better if their
transfer delay is shorter. The nodes of such networks can be less
complex than normal switching centers and may be constructed in a way
that the overall transfer delay in the network is only proportional to
the logarithm of the number of stations, whereas in ring networks it
is always proportional to the number of stations [23].

<p>As throughput and reliability of any network based on superposed
sending cannot be superior than that of a RING-network, these networks
cannot be built with more than 10000 stations either.

<p>In the MIX-network, several factors are to be considered: How many
and which stations act as MIXes and how many MIXes are used per
message?

<p>The message length grows proportionally with the number of MIXes
chosen: to disable an attacker to reproduce the change of encoding of
the message, it must include about 100 random bits for each MIX, which
the deciphering MIX discards. Therefore, the expenditure of
transmission of a message grows quadratically with the number of MIXes
chosen for it. So this number must not be too large. Especially, not
all stations can be chosen as MIXes for all messages.

<p>To guarantee short transfer delay for time critical services, the
throughput of a station that acts as a MIX must be very high because
it always has to have enough messages to mix. These messages must be
decrypted, rearranged, and forwarded. Thus, a MIX should be extremely
powerful and complex, and therefore will not be cheap. Consequently,
only a limited number of MIXes can be afforded in the network.

<p>If the MIX-network is implemented using some user stations of an
existing physical network as MIXes, each message must pass through the
physical network several times, which adds additional delay to that
occuring in the MIXes. But using the switching centers of the physical
network as MIXes can not be recommended either, because the
probability that they collude is too great (and the assumption that
they are independent becomes altogether absurd in countries with a
telecommunication monopoly like the FRG).


<h2>2.2 Hierarchical networks </h2>

As mentioned above, networks which provide sender and recipient
anonymity cannot be built for the number of stations an ISDN would
have. To achieve high performance, it seems reasonable to divide the
network stations statically or dynamically into groups which perform
one of the schemes of paragraph 1.4 and to support the possible
groupings by a physical structure.

<p>The simplest form of such a structure is the switched/broadcast
network (SBNS) which has two levels, broadcast networks based on RINGs
or superposed sending at the lower level and an arbitrary switched
network as backbone (figure 5) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. If the scheme of
superposed sending is used, the SBNS can easily be generalized to a
tree network. The partitioning into local broadcast networks can then
be made variable by changing the depth of the backbone network [23].


<h2>2.3 Channel switching </h2>

<p>So far only networks based on slotted rings with exhaustive service
are suitable for services that require a continuous stream of
information with short transfer delay (channel switching) because once
a station is allowed to use a slot, it can use this slot again and
again as a channel.

<p>The MIX-network is inappropriate for such services because of the
delay during the transport of each message. The networks based on the
concept of superposed sending are of limited use because the basic
medium access protocols do not guarantee synchronous service (called
isochronous in [27 p. 819]).

<p>New possibilities of increasing the performance of these network
are obtained by dropping one requirement for anonymity that seems
unreasonable for channel switching services anyway: the requirement
that the relationship between different messages of the same
connection is hidden [23].

<p>In a network based on superposed sending, channels can then be
switched as in normal broadcast networks.

<p>In a MIX-network in its pure form, the delay results essentially
from the fact that every MIX has to await all bits of a long packet
before it can decrypt it and send the first bit to the next MIX. This
can be avoided if a single message is used for setting up a connection
and giving each MIX a key of a fast private key system used as a
stream cipher. These private keys are used to encrypt the following
messages of the initiated connection just like the public keys in the
normal MIX-network [23].

<p>In a hierarchical network, channels are switched by concatenating
channels of the different levels of the hierarchy.


<h1>3 Fault tolerance </h1>

So far, all networks are serial systems in the sense of reliability:
all MIXes of a chosen sequence of MIXes, all stations of a RING, and
all stations taking part in superposed sending have to work
correctly. To fulfil the high reliability requirements on an ISDN,
each scheme must be extended to include some fault-tolerance
mechanisms. These mechanisms may work end-to-end, i.e. the sender
retransmits a message if it does not receive an acknowledgement after
a certain period of time. Even if the sender chooses a different
encoding of the message for each retransmission, the retransmitted
messages may enable statistical attacks in some networks. Moreover,
the performance of such mechanisms in terms of average transfer delay,
variance of transfer delay, or usable throughput may be
unsatisfactory. Therefore, it seems worthwhile to use mechanisms
which avoid end-to-end retransmission wherever possible.


<h2>3.1 MIX-network </h2>

There are two possibilities to avoid end-to-end retransmission in the
MIX-network: MIXes may choose backups for itself or the user of the
network may enable the MIXes to bypass MIXes which broke down.

<p>Both possibilities are especially useful in the case of return
addresses where the end-to-end timeout and retransmit approach does
not work satisfactorily for all services (e. g. electronic mail).

<p>To realize the first possibility, the private key of a MIX is
distributed to its backups. If a certain amount of time can be spent
on establishing the backup service, a threshold scheme [25] may be
used. MIXes sharing a key must be coordinated to mix each message at
most once [23].

<p>If every MIX in a sequence of chosen MIXes can bypass the next MIX,
a failure of one MIX (or more, as long as no two consecutive MIXes
break down) is tolerable. As in the first possibility, a coordination
protocol must guarantee that each message is mixed at most once [23].

<p>To bypass one MIX, its predecessor must not only get the message
part for it but also for its successor (figure 6). If it receives both
message parts and this is done for every MIX, the length of the whole
message grows exponentially. To avoid this, the sender of a message
chooses a different key (e.g. of a fast private key system) for each
MIX. Together with its message part, each MIX has to get its key, that
of its successor, and the addresses of the next two MIXes, all
together encrypted with its own public key.

<p>Let A1,...,An be the sequence of addresses and e1,...,en the
sequence of public keys of the chosen MIXes MIX1,...,MIXn; An+1 the
address of the addressee (called MIXn+1 for convenience), and en+1 his
public key; k1,...,kn the chosen sequence of keys, and Mi the message
that MIXi shall receive. The messages Mi are formed according to the
following scheme, starting from the message content M that MIXn+1
shall receive:
<p><pre>
      Mn+1 = en+1(M)
      Mn   = en(kn,An+1),kn(Mn+1)
      Mi   = ei(ki,Ai+1,ki+1,Ai+2),ki(Mi+1)   i=1,...,n-1
</pre><p>

So MIXi can compute Mi+1 and Mi+2 out of Mi, but as long as at least
two consecutive MIXes are not controlled by the attacker, the scheme
is as secure as the original one [23]. It is not necessary that both
consecutive uncontrolled MIXes are really passed by the message. One
may be down or intentionally left out to increase performance:
Whenever MIXi+2 is up, MIXi sends Mi+2 to it. Only if MIXi+2 is down,
MIXi sends Mi+1 to MIXi+1. Compared with the obvious solution where
MIXi sends Mi+1 to MIXi+1 first, this saves transmission cost,
increases throughput and decreases transfer delay in the average
(figure 7).

<p>The scheme can easily be modified to tolerate the failure of d
consecutive MIXes instead of one for every fixed number d.


<h2>3.2 Other networks </h2>

The RING-network can be made fault tolerant by using a braided ring
(figure 8) and special protocols [18] (a quantitative examination of
the reliability improvement is given there).

<p>Some remarks on the DC-net and the hierarchical anonymous networks can
be found in [23].


<h1>4 Concluding remarks </h1>

This paper dealt with the design of a network with high performance
and reliability which allows its users to send and to receive
anonymously. As mentioned in section 0, the content of a message can
be hidden by using end-to-end encryption.

<p>If using the network is not for free, the charges must either be
paid anonymously with each use of the network (e.g. by anonymous
numbered accounts [20, 21] or digital banknotes [9, 10]), which seems
rather troublesome, or measured anonymously (e.g. by safeguarded
counters at user stations [20, 21]), or paid by flat rates.

<p>The initially mentioned services like electronic mail, ordering of
newspapers or home banking can be implemented by higher protocols on
top of such a network.

<p>If identification is required instead of anonymity, the well known
authentication schemes can be used. Otherwise it is necessary to
implement the services in a way which preserves the anonymity of the
network. This must be proved in addition to proofs that the
implementation fulfils its normal specification, e.g. security against
fraud [31].

<p>It should be mentioned that many communication services where users
nowadays have to identify themselves can be used in an anonymous way
in the future if there is a protocol that allows people to act under
several pseudonyms and to transform documents that carry one of these
pseudonyms into documents carrying another of their own pseudonyms, in
a secure and anonymous way [6, 7, 10].
