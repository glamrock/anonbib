This expansion has catapulted it       from the realm of academic research towards new-found mainstream acceptance       and increased social relevance for the everyday individual. Yet with this       suddenly increased reliance on the Internet comes the threat that freedoms       previously enjoyed may be overlooked in the online realm.     <p> The World Wide Web (WWW) has recently grown in importance to become perhaps       the most important Internet application today. The WWW enables the ordinary       citizen to reach an audience potentially as large as millions. In short,       this technology gives us an extremely cheap publishing mechanism: printing       presses for the masses.     <p> Yet we must not forget that anonymous publishers have played an important       role throughout the history of publication. Freedom of anonymous speech       is an essential component of free speech, and freedom of speech is a critical       part of any healthy democracy. For instance, the United States Supreme Court       has consistently upheld protection for anonymous publication of political       speech. As Justice Stevens wrote in the <i>McIntyre v Ohio Election Commission</i>       majority opinion,     <p>     <blockquote> Under our Constitution, anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious,       fraudulent practice, but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent.       Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. </blockquote>    <p align="CENTER"> <img src="g1.gif" width="351" height="137" align="TOP">    <p align="LEFT">We should be careful not to forget the importance of anonymous       speech as we move to an increasingly WWW-centric paradigm of communication.     <p align="LEFT"> Today the WWW includes little support for anonymous publishing.       The current WWW architecture fundamentally includes identity information       in the URL that is used to locate published documents, and it is very hard       for a WWW publisher to avoid revealing this information. To address these       limitations, we would like to build technology to enable anonymous publishing       on the World Wide Web.     <p>    <p>    <p><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d2"></a>     <p>     <h2>Motivation</h2>    <p> We briefly motivate this work with a few potential applications for anonymous       WWW publishing. We hope these will help provide some of the general flavor       for the requirements and illustrate the goals of such a publication service.     <p> First, we note that anonymous publication is a time-honored tradition.       The Founding Fathers of the United States published the <i>Federalist Papers</i>       (arguing for the adoption of the Constitution) anonymously under the pseudonym       Publius. Before the American Revolution, many had to publish secretly because       of the very real danger of English prosecution.     <p> Across the world, from medieval times to the current age, governments       have tried to suppress unwanted speech. Political dissidents have often       turned to secret printing and distribution of anonymous leaflets, books,       and other publications. Moreover, dissidents have frequently taken advantage       of technology for expression of controversial ideas: the Protestant Reformation       was greatly aided by the invention of the printing press, which enabled       widespread distribution of many copies of the Bible; the French "Voice of       the Resistance" used nightly radio broadcasts from constantly-changing temporary       locations to reach the people during the German occupation; the United States       used high-power radio stations such as Radio Free Europe during the cold       war to combat censorship behind the Iron Curtain; in past years, banned       information was copied through underground channels from person to person       in the Soviet Union, in a process known as samizdat (which is Russian for       "self-publishing"); and when the Serbian government began jamming the Belgrade       independent radio station during the Serb-Croat war, Serbian students used       the World Wide Web to mirror broadcasts and combat the government's censorship       [<a href="#01">1</a>].     <p> Our vision combines many key aspects of these historically-successful       approaches. First, we want to take advantage of the highly-favorable economics       and vast potential audience available to WWW publishers. Second, we wish       to use anonymity to avoid suppression of controversial ideas: when the targeted       party cannot be identified, it is much harder to bring legal and other pressure       on the author or printer. Third, we aim to gain resilience through the grass       roots nature of samizdat channels. Fourth, because government bureaucracy       often limits the speed with which full legal and other pressure can be brought       to bear on targets to time periods measured in months or years, we wish       to enable temporary stations to pop up and disappear just as rapidly. Through       a combination of these techniques, we hope to build a robust infrastructure       for anonymous WWW publishing.     <p>     <h3><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d3"></a></h3>    <h2>Background</h2>    <p> A few definitions are in order. Anonymity refers to the ability of an       individual to prevent others from linking his identity to his actions. We       can divide anonymity into two cases: persistent anonymity (or pseudonymity),       where the user maintains a persistent online persona ("nym") which is not       connected with the user's physical identity ("true name"); and one-time       anonymity, where an online persona lasts for just one use. The key concept       here is that of linkability: with a nym, one may publish a number of documents       that are all linked together but cannot be linked to the author's true name;       by using one-time anonymity for each work, none of the documents can be       linked to each other or to the user's physical identity. Forward secrecy       refers to the inability of an adversary to recover security-critical information       (such as the true name of the writer of a controversial article) "after       the fact" (e.g. after the writing is published); where possible, providers       of anonymity services should take care to provide forward secrecy, which       entails (for instance) keeping no logs.     <p> We can identify a number of goals for a potential anonymous WWW publishing       infrastructure. First, we should be clear that we only concern ourselves       with the problem of anonymity for the publisher. In contrast, some existing       services, such as the Anonymizer proxy [<ahref="#02">2</a>], aim to provide privacy for the user who is viewing WWW pages;       we explicitly do not attempt to solve that problem. We note that the client       privacy problem is orthogonal to the anonymous publishing problem, and that       the two problems compose well: if full anonymity is needed (to protect the       identity of both endpoints), techniques to anonymize the client will work       well in tandem with an infrastructure for anonymous WWW publishing.     <p> We should also point out another problem we explicitly avoid solving.       Our infrastructure may reveal the fact that a particular server holds anonymous       published data, so long as it does not reveal the data itself or allow the       document to be linked to the author. In short, documents and authors may       each be individually recognized as anonymous, but we aim to prevent the       possibility of linking any one document with its author. As long as there       are sufficiently many anonymous authors (some of whom are respected citizens)       and sufficiently many anonymous documents (some of which are non-controversial       and clearly harmless), there will be "safety in numbers": even if Alice       is identified as an author who has published <em>something</em> anonymously,       Alice will retain very strong plausible deniability protections - the infrastructure       will give authorities no reason to suspect that she is involved in writing       anything other than harmless documents.     <p> We view anonymous WWW publishing as a problem which can benefit from the       experience, approaches, and perspectives of computer security researchers.       In particular, we attempt to identify the relevant threats, design robust       countermeasures, take advantage of defense in depth, and apply other standard       security engineering techniques.     <p align="CENTER"> <img src="g2.gif" width="329" height="207">    <p>One important goal is to avoid the existence of a central single point       of failure. Any such single point of failure becomes a very attractive target       - a sitting duck for the motivated adversary. Instead, we strongly prefer       to distribute trust to obtain resilience in the event that a few network       nodes are compromised or colluding. We wish to see a means by which users       can protect their privacy, preferably by putting privacy-enhancing technology       directly into their own hands inasmuch as is possible. Where the cooperation       of others is necessary to ensure personal privacy, the system should not       be easily subverted by the mere collusion or compromise of a few participants.     <p> A corollary is that we should attempt to minimize the length of time which       a node possesses security-critical information. By limiting the exposure       of information that would reveal the identity of publishers, we reduce the       severity of the risk of compromise. In other words, supporting forward secrecy       is prudent security practice.     <p> We must recognize that in practice there will be tradeoffs between security       and other factors such as performance, availability, stability, etc. Different       publishers will likely require different levels of security, and the only       party who can soundly evaluate the appropriate degree of security is the       publisher himself. Therefore, an important design goal is a flexible security       strength "knob" under control of the individual publishers: publishers should       be able to select the level of security that is appropriate for themselves.     <p> At this point, it is probably appropriate to offer a quick summary of       some possible threats to an infrastructure for anonymous WWW publishing.       A minimal threat model might concern itself primarily with political, legal,       and social attacks, and give less attention to traditional computer security       attack techniques. For instance, an adversary might obtain a subpoena from       a judge of relevant jurisdiction to compromise a targeted node in the distributed       infrastructure. Even an adversary with few resources can recruit the power       of the government to his advantage with such a tactic. Social pressure is       a concern as well; carefully-fabricated complaints to a site administrator       with power over the targeted node may also suffice.     <p> A more cautious threat model will need to take into account the threat       of computer intrusion and attacks on the underlying network. Typically,       individual hosts are rather hard to secure, and in practice motivated penetration       attempts will often succeed in compromising a significant number of nodes.       Furthermore, unprotected network traffic is well-known to be easy to monitor,       redirect, forge, and modify. In cryptographic circles, the adversary is       often presumed to have complete control over the network; while that may       seem a rather paranoid assumption, we know that any system that can stand       up to that level of attack will provide very strong security. However, in       practice such threat models may lead to unrealistic designs. Therefore,       we ought to carefully consider the resources available to likely adversaries,       and tailor the countermeasures to the anticipated threat level. It is probably       realistic to assume that a limited number of nodes will be compromised,       dishonest, or colluding; that the opponent may occasionally be able to successfully       penetrate targeted nodes of his choosing; that the adversary may be eavesdropping       on certain segments of the network; and that the opponent can perform <em>traffic       analysis</em> (statistical analysis using only unencrypted header data such       as source and destination addresses as well as timing coincidences) using       the eavesdropped information. We will attempt to design an infrastructure       that is flexible enough to admit variations that will work under a wide       array of threat models.     <p> Lest we get caught up in the details of obscure security threats, it is       important to remember that security systems can only provide security if       they are used. Therefore, we must take care to ensure that usability is       not sacrificed without careful consideration. In particular, we want to       preserve the vast potential audience provided by the World Wide Web, and       so we require that WWW pages published anonymously using our infrastructure       be accessible from standard WWW browsers without needing any special client       software or anonymity tools. The anonymity services ought to be transparent       to the browser software and WWW page reader. In short, enabling widespread       deployment and use of this infrastructure is a central goal of this work.     <p><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d4"></a>     <h2>Existing Technology</h2>    <p> In this section, we describe some existing privacy-enhancing technologies       for the Internet [<a href="#03">3</a>], in order to see what parts of the       solutions they offer can be carried over to the problem of protecting the       identity of WWW publishers.     <p> In past years e-mail was the most important distributed application, so       it should not be surprising that early efforts at bringing privacy to the       Internet primarily concentrated on e-mail protection. Today the lessons       learned from e-mail privacy provide a foundation of practical experience       that is critically relevant to the design of new privacy-enhancing technologies.     <p> The most primitive way to send e-mail anonymously involves sending the       message to a trusted friend, who deletes the identifying headers and resends       the message body under his identity. Another old technique for anonymous       e-mail takes advantage of the lack of authentication for e-mail headers:       one connects to a mail server and forges fake headers (with falsified identity       information) attached to the message body. Both approaches could also be       used for anonymous posting to newsgroups. Of course, these techniques don't       scale well, and they offer only very minimal assurance of protection.     <p> The technology for e-mail anonymity took a step forward with the introduction       of anonymous remailers. An anonymous remailer can be thought of as a mail       server which combines the previous two techniques, but using a computer       to automate the header-stripping and resending process [<a href="#04">4</a>].       There are basically three styles of remailers; we classify remailer technology       into "types" which indicate the level of sophistication and security.     <p> The <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt> ("type 0") remailer was perhaps the most famous.       It supported anonymous e-mail senders by stripping identifying headers from       outbound remailed messages. It also supported recipient anonymity: the user       was assigned a random pseudonym at <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt>, the remailer       maintained a secret identity table matching up the user's real e-mail address       with his <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt> nym, and incoming e-mail to the nym at <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt>       was retransmitted to the user's real e-mail address. Due to its simplicity       and relatively simple user interface, the <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt> remailer       was the most widely used remailer; sadly, it was shut down recently after       being harassed by legal pressure [<a href="#05">5</a>].     <p> The disadvantage of a <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt> style (type 0) remailer is       that it provides rather weak security. Users must trust it not to reveal       their identity when they send e-mail through it. Worse still, pseudonymous       users must rely on the confidentiality of the secret identity table - their       anonymity would be compromised if it were disclosed, subpoenaed, or bought       - and they must rely on the security of the <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt> site       to resist intruders who would steal the identity table. Furthermore, more       powerful attackers who could eavesdrop on Internet traffic traversing the       <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt> site could match up incoming and outgoing messages       to learn the identity of the nyms. Worst of all, <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt>       becomes a central single point of failure, and it is very dangerous to have       such an attractive target.     <p> Cypherpunk-style (type I) remailers were designed to address these types       of threats. First of all, support for pseudonyms is dropped; no secret identity       table is maintained, and remailer operators take great care to avoid keeping       mail logs that might identify their users. This diminishes the risk of "after-the-fact"       tracing. Second, type I remailers will accept encrypted e-mail, decrypt       it, and remail the resulting message. This prevents the simple eavesdropping       attack where the adversary matches up incoming and outgoing messages. Third,       they take advantage of <em>chaining</em> to achieve more robust security.       Chaining is a technique that involves sending a message through several       anonymous remailers; we discuss chaining more completely below in <a href="#hand">"The       Problem at Hand"</a>. This allows us to take advantage of a distributed       collection of remailers; diversity gives one a better assurance that at       least some of the remailers are trustworthy, and chaining ensures that one       honest remailer (even if we don't know which it is) is all we need. Type       I remailers can also randomly reorder outgoing messages to prevent correlations       of ciphertexts by an eavesdropper. Note that this feature imposes substantial       delays; such increased latency would of course be unacceptable for Web applications.       In short, type I remailers offer greatly improved security over type 0,       though they do have some limitations which we will discuss next.     <p> The newest and most sophisticated remailer technology is the Mixmaster,       or type II, remailer [<a href="#06">6</a>]. They extend the techniques used       in a type I remailer to provide enhanced protection against eavesdropping       attacks. First, one always uses chaining and encryption at each link of       the chain. Second, type II remailers use constant-length messages, to prevent       passive correlation attacks where the eavesdropper matches up incoming and       outgoing messages by size. Third, type II remailers include defenses against       sophisticated replay attacks. Finally, these remailers offer improved message       reordering code to stop passive correlation attacks based on timing coincidences       (which adds still more latency). Because their security against eavesdropping       relies on "safety in numbers" (where the target message cannot be distinguished       from any of the other messages in the remailer net), the architecture also       calls for continuously-generated random cover traffic to hide the real messages       among the random noise.     <p> Another new technology is that of the "newnym"-style nymservers. These       nymservers are essentially a melding of the recipient anonymity features       of a <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt> style remailer with the chaining, encryption,       and other security features of a cypherpunk-style remailer. A user obtains       a pseudonym (e.g. <tt>joeblow@nym.alias.net</tt>) from a nymserver, and       mail to that pseudonym will be delivered to him. However, unlike <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt>,       where the nymserver operator maintained a list matching pseudonyms to real       e-mail addresses, newnym-style nymservers only match pseudonyms to "reply       blocks": the nymserver operator does not have the real e-mail address of       the user, but rather sends the e-mail through a fixed <em>chain</em> that       eventually ends up at the real user. We will use a similar technique in       the section <a href="#hand">"The Problem at Hand"</a>.     <p> With the increasing sophistication in remailer technology, we find that       modern remailers have been burdened with a correspondingly complicated and       obscure interface. To deal with this unfriendly mess, client programs have       sprung up to provide a nicer interface to the remailers. Raph Levien's <tt>premail</tt>       [<a href="#07">7</a>] is the archetypical example. Even so, using remailers       still requires some knowledge; for even greater user-friendliness, we need       this support to be integrated into popular mail handling applications. The       need for specialized clients has made it difficult to widely deploy support       for anonymous e-mail; from this experience, we conclude that an anonymous       WWW publishing infrastructure should not require special tools to browse       WWW pages created by anonymous authors.     <p> The "strip identifying headers and resend" approach used by remailers       has recently been applied to provide anonymity protection for Web browsing       as well. Community ConneXion has sponsored the Anonymizer [<a href="#08">8</a>],       an HTTP proxy that filters out identifying headers and source addresses       from the WWW browser. This allowing users to surf the WWW anonymously without       revealing their identity to WWW servers. However, the Anonymizer offers       rather weak security - no chaining, encryption, log safeguarding, or forward       secrecy - so its security properties are roughly analogous to those of type       0 remailers. Other implementations have since appeared based on the same       approach [<a href="#09">9</a>].     <p>     <h3><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d5"></a></h3>    <h2><a name="hand">The Problem at Hand</a></h2>    <p> We now turn our attention to adapting the above-mentioned technologies       to the problem of anonymous WWW publishing. There are two important distinctions       that must be made between the e-mail and WWW realms:     <p>     <ul>      <li> The WWW is an interactive medium, while e-mail is store-and-forward;         <p>       <li>More notably, e-mail is a "push" technology; the source of the data         initiates the transfer, possibly without even the knowledge or consent         of the receiver. By contrast, HTTP is a "pull" technology; the intended         receiver of the data explicitly requests it from the sender.     </ul>    <p> Some of the security in remailer technology is obtained by randomly reordering       and delaying messages (on time scales ranging from minutes to days). The       first point observes that these delays are unacceptable for WWW requests.       The second point, however, offers us some extra benefit. As we shall see,       the security of a system such as ours or of the remailer network increases       as the number of publicly-accessible cooperating nodes increases. In the       realm of e-mail, operators of remailers often come under fire when their       services are abused by people sending threatening letters or untraceable       spam; the undesirability of handling irate end-users causes the number of       remailers to stay low, potentially impacting on the security of the overall       system. By contrast, an HTTP server cannot initiate a connection with an       unwilling client and send it data when no request was made. This "consensual"       nature of the WWW should cause fewer potential node operators to become       discouraged, and lead to corresponding increases in security.     <p>     <h3>Rewebbers</h3>    <p>     <h3>Description</h3>    <p> Here, then, is the plan. We situate around the world a number of nodes       which we call <em>rewebbers</em> (collectively, these nodes are known as       the <em>rewebber network</em>). Each node is essentially an HTTP proxy which       understands "nested" URLs (i.e. URLs of the form <tt>http://proxy.com/http://realsite.com/</tt>);       most existing HTTP proxies have this behavior. The basic idea is then to       publish a URL such as the one above, which points to <tt>proxy.com</tt>       instead of <tt>realsite.com</tt>.     <p>     <p><img width=726 height=58 align=BOTTOM alt="figure52" src="img1.gif">     <p> <a name="figure1">Figure 1</a>: Schematic diagram of a locator: boxes       with a subscript indicate encryption with a public key; the K's are DESX       keys to use to decrypt the data that is returned. A, B, and C are sites       running rewebbers.     <p> An obvious objection at this point is that this does not hide the real       server name. We solve this problem by using public-key cryptography to encrypt       the real server name so that only the rewebber can read it. In this case,       the URL would look something like <tt>http://proxy.com/!RFkK4J...d_4w/</tt>.       The rewebber at <tt>proxy.com</tt>, upon receiving this URL, would first       decrypt it (the fact that it is encrypted is indicated by the leading <tt>!</tt>       in lieu of the expected <tt>http://</tt>), and then proceed to retrieve       the nested URL in the normal fashion. We call such encrypted URLs <em>locators</em>.     <p> This mechanism hides the real location of the server from the client,       but has other flaws. First of all, once the client has retrieved the data       from the rewebber, he could use one of the more aggressive WWW search engines       to try to find where the document originally came from. We solve this problem       by encrypting the document before storing it on the server. Thus, if the       document is accessed directly (through a search engine, for example), it       will be random data (but see the Section below, <a href="#future">"Future       Work"</a>, for an interesting extension). The encryption used here ought       not be public-key; it should be a symmetric-key algorithm.     <p> We used DESX [<a href="#10">10</a>] in our implementation, but any strong       symmetric-key algorithm would do. Further references to DESX should be taken       as referring to whatever symmetric-key algorithm is in use. The DESX key       is given to the rewebber in the encrypted part of the locator; that is,       when the rewebber decrypts the locator, it finds not only a URL to retrieve,       but a DESX key with which to decrypt the document thus retrieved. It then       passes the decrypted document back to the client.     <p> This technique of encrypting the document stored at the server has another       benefit as well: the document can be padded in size before being encrypted,       and the rewebber will truncate the document to its original size before       passing it back to the client. The reason for doing this is similar to that       for encrypting the document in the first place; if the retrieved document       is 2843 bytes long, for example, a WWW search for encrypted documents near       that size would quickly narrow down the possible choices. To thwart this,       we always add random padding to the end of encrypted documents so that their       total length is one of a handful of fixed sizes. We chose sizes of 10000,       20000, 40000, 80000, etc. bytes, as data in [<a href="#11">11</a>] indicate       that the median size of files on the WWW is a little below 10000 bytes.     <p> We do not use latency-intensive techniques such as full Chaumian mixes,       message reordering, or injecting random delays; interactive WWW browsing       is too delay-sensitive to allow those techniques. This is unfortunate, but       we feel that the resulting decrease in security is somewhat mitigated by       some other features of our system.     <p> If the example above were used as it stood, the rewebber would see both       the real URL of the document, as well as the decrypted document itself.       Thus, if the rewebber is compromised (if its private key leaks out, it is       forced to reveal information, or even had it been being operated by an adversary       all along), it could reveal the mapping between the real site and the document.       The solution is to implement <em>chaining</em>, in the same manner as the       type I remailers mentioned earlier.     <p> To implement chaining, we simply replace the URL in the encrypted portion       of the locator with another complete locator, one which points to a rewebber       at a different site (and preferably, in a different legal jurisdiction).       We can repeat this process, thus making the rewebber chain listed in the       locator (in encrypted form) as long as we like. A schematic diagram of a       locator containing a rewebber chain of length 3 appears in <a href="#figure1">Figure       1</a>. In the next subsection, we identify tradeoffs associated with choosing       a length for a rewebber chain.     <p> When using chaining, the document will need to be multiply encrypted on       the server. To do this, the publisher randomly selects a DESX key for each       rewebber in the chain, encodes them into the locator as depicted in <a href="#figure1">Figure       1</a>, and iteratively encrypts the document. In this way the publisher       forms a locator and announces it to the world (by using an anonymous remailer       to post it to a newsgroup, for example). Note that all of the security parameters,       including the number of rewebbers in the chain, are under the control of       the publisher; individual publishers may adjust this "knob" to suit their       anonymity needs.     <p align="CENTER"> <img src="g3.gif" width="363" height="191">    <p>The main benefit of chaining is that only the rewebber closest to the client       ever sees the decrypted data, and only the rewebber closest to the server       knows where it is really getting data came from. In order to link the two,       the cooperation of every rewebber in the chain would be necessary. We note       that this avoids the existence of a single point of failure, and allows       us to distribute trust throughout the network. The use of chaining and locators       here is the rewebber's counterpart of the use of "reply blocks" by nymservers       (mentioned above). Remember that there will likely be many opaque WWW requests       flowing through the network at any one point; there is "safety in numbers".     <p> Finally, we point out a serendipitous aspect of using HTTP proxies to       implement rewebbers. These proxies tend to have caches, in order to improve       network performance. Somewhat conveniently, they also turn out to give us       an extra benefit. The fact that data is being cached at the intermediate       rewebbers in a chain makes it less likely that requests will actually get       forwarded all the way back to the publisher. This makes traffic analysis       somewhat harder to accomplish. Note that traffic analysis relies on having       a large sample of network data to perform statistical analysis; by reducing       the amount of traffic on the network, less data is available to a traffic       analyst, and so statistical patterns will be harder to discern. Also note       that this form of caching gives us the political benefit that rewebber nodes       never cache unencrypted data, and so it is less likely they can be held       accountable for controversial material they happen to be caching.     <p>     <h3>Analysis</h3>    <p> In this section, we make some computations regarding the security and       the reliability of the rewebber network described above. Here, a <em>node</em>       is a site running a rewebber proxy; a <em>compromised node</em> is a node       for which logs are available to an adversary (in order that the adversary       may learn which decrypted URL (or locator) corresponds to which encrypted       locator), or simply one for which the private key is so available (whether       because of host compromise, or because the operator of the node was an adversary       in the first place). Let <i>n</i> be the number of nodes in the rewebber       network, and let <i>c</i> be the number of compromised nodes. Suppose a       publisher wished to pick <i>k</i> nodes through which to chain. In the <em>worst       case</em>, we would have no clue which nodes were compromised (or even which       were more likely to be compromised), and he would choose the <i>k</i> nodes       uniformly at random with replacement (as we assume <i>k</i> is small as       compared to <i>n</i>, sampling with or without replacement makes little       difference, but sampling with replacement gives a worst-case bound).     <p>     <p><img width=331 height=238 align=BOTTOM alt="figure75" src="img2.gif">     <p> <a name="figure2">Figure 2</a>: Probability of compromised path<br>    <p>     <p> We now calculate the probability of a <em>compromised path</em>. Here       our threat model is that all of the nodes in the chain collude to decrypt       the publisher's published locator, in order to determine the publisher's       WWW site (assumedly from that information learning some information about       his identity). In this model, the worst-case probability of a compromised       path is <img width=20 height=23 align=MIDDLE alt="tex2html_wrap_inline404" src="img3.gif">. A plot of this value for various values of <i>k</i> appears       in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>. Looking at this result, it would seem       that choosing a larger value of <i>k</i> would always be preferable.     <p> However, we now consider <em>reliability</em>. We call a node <em>broken</em>       if for some reason it is unable (or unwilling) to decrypt locators and forward       the resulting URLs (or locators). If <i>b</i> is the number of broken nodes       in the network, then a chain of <i>k</i> rewebbers will suffer <em>path       failure</em> if any of the nodes on it is broken. Assuming that the broken       nodes are randomly distributed (at least with respect to the nodes in the       chain), this occurs with probability. This value is plotted for various       values of <i>k</i> in <ahref="#figure3">Figure 3</a>.     <p>     <p><img width=331 height=238 align=BOTTOM alt="figure85" src="img5.gif">     <p> <a name="figure3">Figure 3</a>: Probability of path failure<br>    <p>     <p> When choosing <i>k</i>, then, a tradeoff needs to be made between the       probability of path compromise and the probability of path failure. The       smart choice is usually to give higher priority to preventing path compromise;       path compromise is catastrophic, but path failure is "fail-safe": requests       will not succeed until a new locator is created and published, but the identity       of the publisher will not be revealed.     <p> Some additional heuristics can be used to further decrease the probability       of path compromise. First of all, a slight decrease can be gained by choosing       the rewebbers to form a chain without replacement (so that no rewebber appears       twice in a chain). More interestingly, we could use knowledge about the       independence (or lack thereof) of rewebbers. It seems logical to assume       that the closer two rewebbers are in terms of administrative control, the       more likely it would be that their compromises would be correlated. For       example, two rewebbers run by the same person are likely to have high compromise       correlation; rewebbers run in the same administrative domain would have       somewhat high correlation; rewebbers in the same legal jurisdiction would       have higher correlation than rewebbers in different countries, etc. Therefore,       a clever choice of rewebber chain would tend to include rewebbers being       run by different people, preferably in different countries.     <p>     <h3>Implementation</h3>    <p> We implemented a rewebber on top of the scalable TACC server architecture       described in [<a href="#11">11</a>]. This architecture provided us with       a high-performance scalable HTTP proxy and caching system, on top of which       it was straightforward to implement the extra functionality necessary for       a rewebber. We observe excellent performance with our prototype implementation;       CPU costs are minimized with the scalable TACC server, so that network costs       dominate, and network costs are themselves reduced with the caching provided       by the TACC architecture.     <p> We also implemented the handful of tools necessary for publishers to pick       random DESX keys, create locators, and encrypt the files they wish to place       on their server.     <p> All of the crypto portions of the code will likely be recoded from scratch       the next time the first author goes to a country with somewhat less ridiculous       laws about publishing cryptography, so that they can be released.     <p>     <h3>TAZ Servers</h3>    <p> Once a rewebber network is deployed, the stage will be set for the ability       to publish anonymously on the WWW. One major drawback, however, is that       a locator that contains just a simple chain of rewebbers looks something       like this:     <p>     <pre>http://rewebber.com/!RjVi0rawjGRT50ECKo_UBa7Qv3FJlRbyej_Wh10g_9vpPAyeHmrYE1QL1H2ifNh2Ma4UYt3IaqeQRXXd7oxEvwR8wJ3cnrNbPF6rc1Uzr6mxIWUtlgW0uRlL0bGkAv3fX8WEcBd1JPWGT8VoY0F1jxgPL7OvuV0xtbMPsRbQg0iY=RKLBaUYedsCn0N-UQ0m5JWTE1nuoh_J5J_yg1CfkaN9jSGkdf51-gdj3RN4XHf_YVyxfupgc8VPsSyFdEeR0dj9kMHuPvLivE_awqAwU_3Af8mc44QBN0fMVJjpeyHSa79KdTQ5EGlPzLK7upFXtUFcNLSD7YLSc1gKI3X8nk15s=RXbQaqm0Ax4VhKPwkLVK_MMJaz9wchn_pI48xhTzgndt5Hk09VToLyz7EF4wGH3XKPD7YbKVyiDZytva_sUBcdqpmPXTzApYLBnl4nDOy1o1Pu1Rky8CxRfnC9BvQqof853n99vkuGKP9K4p3H7pl6i8DOat-NrOIndpz5xgwZKc=/</pre>    <p> It is evident that there is a naming problem and that it needs to be solved.     <p> We therefore create a virtual namespace called the <tt>.taz</tt> namespace,       and we create new servers called <em>TAZ servers</em> to resolve this namespace.       TAZ stands for Temporary Autonomous Zone [<a href="#12">12</a>]; the emphasis       here is that <tt>.taz</tt> sites can relocate quickly, utilizing the level       of indirection offered by the TAZ server.     <p> The function of a TAZ server is to offer publishers an easy way to point       potential readers at their material, as well as offering readers an easy       way to access it. A TAZ server consists essentially of a <em>public</em>       database mapping virtual hostnames ending in <tt>.taz</tt> to rewebber locators.       The emphasis on "public" is to stress that nothing in this database is a       secret; unlike <tt>anon.penet.fi</tt>-style (type 0) remailers (which associate       a virtual e-mail address with a real one), TAZ servers merely associate       <tt>.taz</tt> addresses with locators. In practice, the TAZ server database       would also usually contain a hash of a password, so as to effect access       control for updates to the database, but this need not be secret information.       Most importantly, the TAZ server operator <em>cannot decrypt the locators</em>       that are in its database.     <p> The public nature of the TAZ database brings several benefits. First of       all, it provides protection for TAZ server operators: there is no incentive       to threaten them with legal, social, or political pressure, because any       information the operator can access is also publicly available. It would       be prudent to widely publicize this fact, in order to reduce the inevitable       flood of requests for identity information. Second, it separates the document       location problem from the rewebber network, so we get extensibility: TAZ       servers can be readily upgraded without needing to change existing rewebber       code. Finally, the purely public nature of TAZ databases gives very strong       security benefits, because it ensures that the TAZ servers cannot reduce       the security of the system. TAZ servers may very well become extremely complicated       in the future, if some type of coherent dynamic distributed database were       implemented. In such a future, we would be very glad that the security of       our system does not rely on the security of the TAZ servers.     <p> We are not overly concerned with the authenticity of the TAZ database,       because the best solution is to rely on end-to-end authentication [<a href="#13">13</a>].       Anonymous publishers concerned about forgeries should establish a public       key for their pseudonym, sign all anonymous documents with this key, and       distribute their nym's public key widely along with their <tt>.taz</tt>       hostname.     <p> One very important feature to note about TAZ servers is that the mechanism       it provides (resolving virtual names to locators) is completely orthogonal       to the rewebber mechanism; there is no need for the operator of a TAZ server       to also run a rewebber, nor vice versa. A TAZ server is merely a convenient       central repository for a public database.     <p> Currently, we have two interfaces to a working TAZ server available; each       interface offers a slightly different way of sending a rewebber locator       to any standard WWW client. At <ahref="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/taz/">http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/ta       z/</a> is a list of all currently registered <tt>.taz</tt> hosts. From this       page, one can click on a host's name, and be taken to that page (the <tt>HREF</tt>       in the link points to the locator for the host). Also, to access a specific       host (<tt>cellspec.taz</tt> for example), one can just use the URL <tt>http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/taz.cgi/cellspec.taz/</tt>       (the CGI on this page issues an HTTP Redirect which points to the locator).     <p> These centralized approaches will work fine, until the namespace gets       too big or the central <tt>.taz</tt> server becomes a bottleneck; then we       will probably prefer to move to a decentralized distributed solution for       better scalability and availability. This issue is addressed further in       the section <a href="#future">"Future Work"</a>.     <p>     <h3><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d6"></a> </h3>    <h2>Related Work</h2>    <p> Ross Anderson proposes the Eternity Service [<a href="#14">14</a>], which       is intended to provide very long-term digital storage and publication. It       is intended to offer strong availability guarantees even in presence of       adversarial attacks. While the Eternity Service shares several similar features       with anonymous WWW publication, the Eternity Service is especially geared       towards highly-available publication; anonymity is not a direct goal. The       contrast is perhaps best appreciated with a direct quote from the paper:     <p>     <blockquote>The net effect will be that your file, once posted on the eternity       service, cannot be deleted. As you cannot delete it yourself, you cannot       be forced to delete it, either by abuse of process or by a gun at your wife's       head.</blockquote>    <p> Note that our design would attempt to stop threats like "a gun at your       wife's head" by protecting your anonymity, so that the thugs will not know       whose wife to point a gun at.     <p> Anderson discusses a number of engineering tradeoffs involved in building       such a service. One interesting observation is that anonymous communication       models can stand as a countermeasure against denial of service attacks;       thus, in the context of the Eternity Service anonymity is viewed as a useful       technique to increase availability, rather than a goal in and of itself.       No implementation or full design of Anderson's functional specification       is available, probably because of the very aggressive design goals, but       we can learn some interesting lessons about the engineering tradeoffs in       highly available publication from this paper.     <p> There has also been some recent work on building infrastructures for general-purpose       interactive anonymous communication on the Internet. We can learn a great       deal about the challenges of anonymity for low-latency communications. One       important lesson to take away from these efforts is that there are a great       deal many clever and powerful attacks against low-latency anonymized traffic       when adversaries have control over many segments of the network.     <p> Wei Dai's PipeNet architecture [<a href="#15">15</a>] is based on a distributed       network of packet forwarders, connected by long-term encrypted communications       links that are padded to constant bandwidth when not in use to prevent traffic       analysis; Chaumian mixes are used at each router node. The result is much       like a low-latency IP-level cousin of the type II remailer network, with       the addition of a lot of cover traffic to make up for the increased potential       for timing attacks that arises from the low-latency requirements. The requirement       for constant-bandwidth long-lived encrypted links incurs serious performance       costs to provide security against this very cautious threat model of pervasive       eavesdropping on the network. No complete PipeNet design, much less implementation,       is available, and PipeNet does not appear to be a serious candidate for       practical deployment in the short term; but PipeNet was an influential early       proposal for anonymous communication that established the possibility a       high level of security and illuminated a number of subtle possible attacks       on such a system.     <p> A more recent and mature research effort to build a practical infrastructure       for interactive anonymous Internet traffic is the Onion Routing project       [<ahref="#16">16</a>]. The Onion Routing proposal embodies slightly more practically-oriented       engineering decisions than vanilla PipeNet. For instance, links are not       padded to constant bandwidth; instead, Chaumian mixes and "safety in numbers"       is used to protect against traffic analysis. The authors do not attempt       to protect against attackers who can control (or monitor) many diverse portions       of the network simultaneously. By taking on slightly less ambitious goals,       the Onion Routing researchers have managed to design a full system and preliminary       implementations are available.     <p> Our rewebber system bears a certain resemblance to PipeNet and Onion Routing;       after all, it is essentially attempting to anonymize low-latency IP traffic.       However, for our sanity, we have simplified the problem in a number of ways.       First, our rewebbers operate at the application layer, rather than the network       layer, which enables us to make several optimizations and simplifications:       we take advantage of the request-reply nature of HTTP, and take advantage       of the weak semantics of HTTP as well as the relatively static nature of       WWW pages to cache data throughout the system. Second, to achieve very rapid       implementation and deployment, we have weakened the threat model somewhat;       protection against network attacks is deemed a lower priority (and much       harder problem) than immediate deployment with protection against political,       legal, and social attacks. We expect to build upon the rewebber system to       improve its security against network attacks as experience with Onion Routing       and the general low-latency communications anonymity problem improves. Third,       we note that infrastructures for routing general IP packets anonymously       is subject to a potentially unprecedented levels of abuse: malicious hackers       could use this service to break into vast numbers of Internet-connected       hosts without fear of discovery. In contrast, by restricting ourselves to       the problem of anonymous Web publication, we can avoid worrying about abuse.       Finally, we note that once the Onion Routing infrastructure becomes widely       available, we could easily add support for anonymous publishers connected       via Onion Routing links, if we expected that publishers were sophisticated       enough to take advantage of the Onion Routing infrastructure; that allows       us to take advantage of the best of both worlds.     <p> URNs (Universal Resource Names) [<a href="#17">17</a>] attempt to address       nearly the same naming problem as TAZ servers do. Both attempt to provide       short persistent names for resources via a simple resolving mechanisms,       using the standard computer science trick - a level of indirection. The       major difference is that, when a URN ultimately points to a resource described       by a URL, it is a design goal that one be able to learn the pointed-to URL       from the URN; in contrast, the whole point of the anonymous WWW publishing       infrastructure is that, given a TAZ name, one cannot obtain the URL for       the author's real site. These differences notwithstanding, future experience       with URN resolving mechanisms is likely to lead to improved name resolution       service from the TAZ servers.     <p><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d7"></a>     <h2><a name="future">Future Work</a></h2>    <p> There are a number of possible improvements to the rewebber system. Currently       we implement some but not all of the features of type I and type II remailers;       we do not provide strong security against wide-area network attacks at present.       It would be interesting to explore techniques for better security. For instance,       we could apply "fan-out" - where one request to a first-hop rewebber spawns       several parallel requests to unrelated sites (whose responses are ignored)       - to attempt to generate some cover traffic and disguise the location of       the publisher's endpoint. A variation on "fan-out" can be used to attempt       to increase availability in the presence of network faults: include several       independent paths to the content in the locator, and then if one fails because       of a network error, the content can still be retrieved. More generally,       these "fan-out" schemes can be generalized using <i>k</i>-out-of-<i>n</i>       secret sharing schemes, where a single client request fans out into <i>n</i>       requests inside the rewebber network, and any <i>k</i> responses suffice       to recover the content. All of these schemes need to be analyzed to examine       just how much benefit they provide, and what cost they impose upon the system.     <p> It would be valuable to carefully analyze the security benefit that application-level       caching affords us. We have not worked this out in detail yet, because at       this point we consider eavesdropping and other network attacks a second       priority. However, it appears that very large benefits may potentially be       available, especially if caching is combined with a special high-security       mechanism using considerable reordering and random delays for non-interactive       pre-fetching to warm the caches.     <p> Another improvement to the rewebber system would take advantage of steganography       [<a href="#18">18</a>] to hide the fact that a particular author has published       some (unspecified) works anonymously. Currently an anonymous author must       store encrypted data on his WWW server, but ciphertext usually stands out;       by disguising the encrypted data file within normal-looking data (e.g. within       the low bits of a large image or sound file), we can avoid this problem.       That would allow an anonymous publisher to camouflage himself and blend       in among all the other noise on the World Wide Web.     <p> There is the potential for a great deal of future work in the TAZ servers.       Centralized solutions such as the ones we have implemented may work well       for a while, but in the future decentralized solutions may be preferable,       for both scalability and availability reasons. Of course, a distributed       naming database would incur all the coherency, performance, and other problems       found in a dynamic distributed database; we expect that a great deal can       be learned from DNS. Two possible decentralized methods worthy of further       study are multicast capable servers, and Usenet-based updates (a form of       slow multicast). If the <tt>.taz</tt> namespace starts becoming too large,       we will have all the problems of a static <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> file with       our current implementation, and a transition to a more scalable solution       will be of paramount importance.     <p> In any case, more implementation and real-life deployment experience is       needed to understand the engineering tradeoffs better. Fortunately, by separating       the TAZ database from the rewebber system, and by ensuring that the TAZ       database contains only public data (and so is not security-critical), we       have reserved great flexibility for upgrading this portion of the system.     <p><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d8"></a>     <h2>Conclusion</h2>    <p> We have designed a practical infrastructure that enables anonymous publishing       on the World Wide Web. Some key features include universal accessibility       by standard clients, short persistent names, security against social, legal,       and political pressure, protection against abuse, and good performance.     <p> We have completed a prototype implementation, and we expect to start deploying       more mature code for practical use this summer. Implementation was eased       by using the scalable TACC server architecture [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Extensibility       is provided by separating the naming and document location problem from       the core document anonymization services.     <p> One novel contribution was the observation that caching can be used to       improve not just performance but also improve security against network eavesdroppers       as well. More generally, by providing anonymity services at the application       layer, we were able to take advantage of the semantics of the World Wide       Web to simplify and optimize our system.     <p> In short, we have demonstrated that anonymous publishing for the World       Wide Web is well within practical reach today. <img src="/img/endof.gif">    <p>     <p><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="author"></a>     <h2>About the Authors</h2>    <a href="mailto:iang@cs.berkeley.edu"><b>Ian Goldberg</b></a><b> </b>and <ahref="mailto:daw@cs.berkeley.edu"><b>David Wagner</b></a> are Graduate Student     Researchers and founding members of the ISAAC research group at the University     of California, Berkeley.
