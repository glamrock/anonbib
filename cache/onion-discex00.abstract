Onion Routing is an infrastructure for private communication over a
public network. It provides anonymous connections that are strongly
resistant to both eavesdropping and traffic analysis. Thus it hides not
only the data being sent, but who is talking to whom. Onion Routing's
anonymous connections are bidirectional and near real-time, and can be
used anywhere a socket connection can be used. Proxy aware
applications, such as web browsing and e-mail, require no modification
to use Onion Routing, and do so through a series of proxies. Other
applications, such as remote login, can also use the system without
modification. Access to an onion routing network can be configured in a
variety of ways depending on the needs, policies, and facilities of
those connecting. This paper describes some of these access
configurations and also provides a basic overview of Onion Routing and
comparisons with related work.

The primary goal of Onion Routing is to provide private, traffic
analysis resistant communications over a public network at reasonable
cost and efficiency.  Communications are intended to be private in the
sense that both the public network itself and any eavesdropper on the
network cannot determine the contents of messages flowing from Alice
and Bob, and she cannot tell that Alice and Bob are communicating with
each other.  A secondary goal is to provide anonymity to the sender
and receiver, so that Alice may receive messages but be unable to
identify the sender, even though she may be able to reply those
messages.  For example, open source intelligence gathering via the web
and pseudonym based email communications that hide the true identities
of both sender and receiver.

Preserving privacy means not only hiding the content of
messages, but also hiding who is talking to whom (traffic analysis).
Much like a physical envelope, the simple application of cryptography
within a packet-switched network hides the messages being sent, but
can reveal who is talking to whom, and how often.  Onion Routing is a
general purpose infrastructure for private communication over a public
network.  It provides anonymous connections
that are strongly resistant to both eavesdropping and traffic
analysis.  The connections are bidirectional, near real-time, and can
be used for both connection-based and connectionless traffic.  Onion
Routing interfaces with off the shelf software and systems through
specialized proxies, making it easy to integrate into existing
systems.  Prototypes have been running since July 1997.  As of this
article's publication, the prototype network is processing more than 1
million Web connections per month from more than six thousand IP
addresses in twenty countries and in all six main top level
domains.
<P>Onion Routing operates by dynamically building anonymous
connections within a network of real-time Chaum Mixes.  A Mix is
a store and forward device that accepts a number of
fixed-length messages from numerous sources, performs cryptographic
transformations on the messages, and then forwards the messages to the
next destination in a random order.  A single Mix makes tracking of a
particular message either by specific bit-pattern, size, or ordering with
respect to other messages difficult.  By routing through numerous
Mixes in the network, determining who is talking to whom becomes even more
difficult.  Onion Routing's network of core onion-routers (Mixes) is
distributed,
fault-tolerant, and under the control of multiple administrative
domains, so no single onion-router can bring down the network or
compromise a user's privacy, and cooperation between compromised
onion-routers
is thereby confounded.

Onion Routing is an infrastructure for private communication over a
public network.  It provides anonymous connections that are strongly
resistant to both eavesdropping and traffic analysis.  Onion routing's
anonymous connections are bidirectional and near real-time, and can be
used anywhere a socket connection can be used. (In some contexts not
even socket connections are needed to use onion routing.) Any
identifying information must be in the data stream carried over an
anonymous connection.  An onion is a data structure that is treated as
the destination address by onion routers; thus, it is used to establish
an anonymous connection. Onions themselves appear differently to each
onion router as well as to network observers. The same goes for data
carried over the connections they establish.  Proxy aware applications,
such as web browsing and email, require no modification to use onion
routing, and do so through a series of proxies. A prototype of onion
routing is running in our lab. This paper describes anonymous
connections and their implementation using onion routing. This paper
also describes several application proxies for onion routing, as well
as configurations of onion routing networks.

This paper describes a communications primitive, <EM>anonymous
connections</EM>, that support bidirectional and near real-time
channels that are resistant to both eavesdropping and traffic
analysis.  The connections are made anonymous, although communication
need not be.  These anonymous connections are versatile and support
private use of many different Internet services.  For our purposes,
privacy means maintaining the confidentiality of both the data stream
and the identity of communicating parties.  These are both kept
confidential from network elements as well as external observers.
Private Web browsing is achieved by unmodified Web browsers using
anonymous connections by means of HTTP proxies.  Private Web browsing
may be made anonymous too by a specialized proxy that removes
identifying information from the HTTP data stream.  This article
specifies anonymous connections, describes our implementation, and
discusses its application to Web browsing via HTTP proxies.

The World Wide Web is rapidly becoming an important tool for modern
day communication and commerce.  But electronic messages sent over the
Internet can be easily snooped and tracked revealing who is talking to
whom and what they are talking about.  Is privacy important and how
can it be guaranteed?  This paper describes how a freely available
system, onion routing, can be used to provide privacy for a wide
variety of Internet services, including Virtual Private Networks, Web
browsing, e-mail, remote login, and electronic cash.

This paper describes security protocols that
use anonymous channels, which do not reveal their endpoints,
as primitive, much in the way that key distribution protocols take
encryption as primitive. This abstraction allows us to focus on
high level security goals of these protocols much as abstracting away
from encryption clarifies and emphasizes high level security goals
of key distribution protocols. The protocols described are
for mobile applications that protect
the location information of the participating principals.

Onion Routing provides anonymous connections that are strongly
resistant to both eavesdropping and traffic analysis. Unmodified
Internet applications can use these anonymous connections by means of
proxies. The proxies may also make communication anonymous by removing
identification from the data stream.  Onion Routing has been
implemented on Sun Solaris 2.4 with proxies for Web browsing, remote
logins, and e-mail.  This paper's contribution is a detailed
specification of the implemented onion routing system, a vulnerability
analysis base on this specification, and performance results.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Determining who is talking to whom (called traffic analysis) is an
important source of intelligence information.  As military grade
communication devices increasingly depend on the public communications
infrastructure, it is important to use that infrastructure in ways
that are resistant to traffic analysis.  It may also be useful to
communicate anonymously, for example when gathering intelligence from
public databases.  We describe bidirectional and real-time <EM>Anonymous
Connections</EM> that are strongly resistant to eavesdropping and traffic
analysis attacks by both insiders and outsiders.  If necessary,
communication is made anonymous by removing identifying information
from the data stream.  These anonymous connections have been
prototyped in a system that protects the privacy of communication over
the Internet and, in particular, the World Wide Web.  Anonymous
connections can protect both identity and location in many switched
communication systems, such as wired, cellular, or satellite phone
networks.

Using traffic analysis, it is possible to infer who is talking to whom
over a public network.  This paper describes a flexible communication
infrastructure, Onion Routing, which is resistant to traffic
analysis.  Onion Routing lives just beneath the application layer, and
is designed to interface with a wide variety of unmodified Internet
services by means of proxies.  Onion Routing has been implemented on
Sun Solaris 2.4; in addition, proxies for World Wide Web browsing (HTTP),
remote logins (RLOGIN), e-mail (SMTP), and file transfers (FTP) have been
implemented.
<P>
Onion Routing provides application independent, real-time, and
bi-directional anonymous connections that are resistant to both
eavesdropping and traffic analysis.  Applications making use of Onion
Routing's anonymous connections may (and usually should) identify
their users over the anonymous connection.  User anonymity may be
layered on top of the anonymous connections by removing identifying
information from the data stream.  Our goal here is anonymous
connections, not anonymous communication.  The use of a packet
switched public network should not automatically reveal who is talking
to whom.  This is the traffic analysis that Onion Routing complicates.

This paper describes an architecture, Onion Routing, that limits a
network's vulnerability to traffic analysis. The architecture provides
anonymous socket connections by means of proxy servers. It provides
real-time, bi-directional, anonymous communication for any protocol
that can be adapted to use a proxy service. Specifically, the
architecture provides for bi-directional communication even though
no-one but the initiator's proxy server knows anything but previous
and next hops in the communication chain. This implies that neither
the respondent nor his proxy server nor any external observer need
know the identity of the initiator or his proxy server. A prototype of
Onion Routing has been implemented. This prototype works with HTTP
(World Wide Web) proxies. In addition, an analogous proxy for TELNET
has been implemented. Proxies for FTP and SMTP are under development.
